# 🛍️ Aarya Store – Wix Exported E-commerce Website

This project is a **static e-commerce website** originally built using **Wix Website Builder** and then exported as raw HTML/CSS files. It simulates a storefront experience with visually appealing sections, a shopping layout, and a chat widget—all viewable locally in your browser.

## 🚀 Features

- 🧾 **Homepage Layout**: Features store branding and content blocks
- 💬 **Wix Chat Integration**: Simulated customer support widget
- 🌐 **Responsive Elements**: Optimized layout for basic screen sizes
- 🛠️ **Editable HTML**: Fully customizable for personal or demo use
- 💡 **No Backend Required**: Purely front-end; works offline
